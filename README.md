# The Hard-sphere (HS) and Hard-sphere + hydrophobicity (HS+HP) protein models

This repository contains the necessary files to parameterize and run multiple versions the HS and HS+HP models under energy minimization and Langevin dynamics.

This project was initially developed to understand the jamming transition in folded proteins. Read more: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09646
